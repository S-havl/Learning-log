# Learning-log
Personal logs, commands, notes and concepts I’ve learned on my path through Linux, systems, networking and security.

# 🧠 Learning-log

This is my personal learning log — a space to record what I’ve learned, what I’ve broken, and what I’ve fixed along the way.

It includes terminal commands, theoretical notes, real problems I’ve faced, and concepts that took time to click.

I started with scripting in Roblox Studio (Luau), and eventually found my place exploring Linux internals, networking, and ethical hacking. This repo reflects that shift — from surface-level curiosity to deep technical understanding.

## 🧭 Why I Made This

I don’t believe in learning fast.  
I believe in learning deeply.

This log helps me:
- Keep track of what I learn, even if it's out of order
- Revisit older concepts I didn't fully grasp the first time
- Document errors I faced and how I solved them
- Reflect on what actually helped me improve

## 📌 How to Use This

This is not a tutorial for others.  
It’s a log for myself — raw, honest, evolving.

Still, if someone finds value in my path or notes, feel free to explore. Just know that this is written for future me.
