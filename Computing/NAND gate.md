A NAND gate, in the field of computing, is used to build electronic circuits through logical operations. It is considered the most fundamental logic gate, as other gates such as XOR, AND, and NOT can be constructed from it. Its implementation is based on transistors, which are made of silicon using advanced manufacturing processes.
